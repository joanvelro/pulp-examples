Optimization with PuLP
----------------------

You can begin learning Python and using PuLP
by looking at the content below. We recommend that you read The Optimisation Process,
Optimisation Concepts, and the Introduction to Python
before beginning the case-studies. For instructions for the installation of PuLP
see :ref:`installation`.

The full PuLP function documentation is available, and useful functions
will be explained in the case studies.
The case studies are in order, so the later case studies will assume you have
(at least) read the earlier case studies. However, we will provide links to any
relevant information you will need.
