# Rostering Problem usingÂ Python

The nurse scheduling problem (NSP), also called the nurse rostering problem (NRP), is the operations research problem of finding an optimal way to assign nurses to shifts, typically with a set of hard constraints which all valid solutions must follow, and a set of soft constraints which define the relative quality of valid solutions. Solutions to the nurse scheduling problem can be applied to constrained scheduling problems in other fields.

The nurse scheduling problem has been studied since before 1969, and is known to have NP-hard complexity

## DESCRIPTION
Used the PuLP package in Python to formulate and solve a simple rostering problem

## Getting Started

1. Open the jupyter notebook 
2. Install the required libraries (optional)
4. Execute the code

## Data Files

1. role_optimization_final.xlsm is the excel report that contains the roster created using a pivot table
2. formulation.png is the mathematical model that was built as part of the excercise
